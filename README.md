# A simple iOS demo for AsyncDisplayKit

AsyncDisplayKit is an iOS framework developed in order to optimize your app by making user interfaces thread safe, which means that you will be able to shift all your expensive views into background threads, preparing them before presenting. It's a great way to make your app elegant, smooth and has a responsive user interface.

This simple demo shows you how to use the display kit to build a Meetup client app. For the full tutorial, you can check it out here:
